# Sorting-ALLgorithms
Learning to program sorting algorithms.  

This program will have code for multiple sorting algorithms that are pulled into one mast program.  Eventually I would like to add either matplotlib or pygame to display visual representation of the sorting algorithms working at this same time through multiple threads
